    <h1>How the COVID-19 Pandemic, and Increased Popularity of Food Delivery Services, Effected the Dining Culture in America</h1>
     <h2>By: Isabelle Trujillo</h2>
     <h3>Introduction to Project</h3>
    <p>The issue I will be examining for my project proposal is how the COVID-19 pandemic, and increased popularity of food delivery services, effected the dining culture in America. I would like to explore “the traditional family outing,” and how it has been impacted, specifically how traditional spaces that were used as hubs for the community have been altered since the start of the pandemic.<br> The general area to be studied is interpersonal communication, as I would be comparing the interactions of people in dining spaces before and during the pandemic, then using the data to illustrate the implications for what shared space could look like in the future. This is an important area to study within interpersonal communications, as it could give insight on what modern, basic, family values are in America; this project would also shed light on the important role that dining and food plays in American culture.</p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
     <p>I currently do not know much about the field surrounding dining culture in America, outside of my own experience as someone who ate in public/ community spaces, and as an employee of a restaurant throughout the pandemic. According to Statista, an online statistical web bank, “Due to measures of social distancing and general caution in public places, consumers were forced to dine out less. According to the source, the year-over-year change of seated diners in restaurants in the U.S., compared to 2019, was -11 percent on October 13, 2021” (Statista, 2021). The information that helped me to find this research topic was found in several statistics charts like the one referenced previously, about the decline of restaurants and shared spaces after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the increased use of food delivery services.  These statistics are important, although they lack the ability to illustrate how it is to experience the effect that COVID-19 has had on how people interact with one another, and how we now experience community spaces (e.g., restaurants). I feel that the statistics leave me asking the question, “Are these spaces an integral part of American culture, to the point that the decline in restaurants should be seen as a loss?” In my project, I hope to examine this question, and detail importance of dining culture within America.</p>
     <h3>Rationale</h3>
     <p>Some specific question that I hope to explore are:
     <ul>
        <li>“What does the average meal look like for a family before and after the pandemic?”</li>
        <li>“Have food delivery services increased since the start of the pandemic, how much? And how has this increase impacted restaurants?”</li>
        <li>“Is dining in public spaces, like restaurants or cafes, an integral part of American culture?”</li>
        <li>"Should these shared spaces be protected? Or should the effect the pandemic had on restaurants signal the need for a new space that modernizes and embraces the change that the pandemic brought?”</li> <br>These questions are all related to the larger issue of how the COVID-19 pandemic, and increased use of food delivery services, effected dining culture in America, as they all discuss either the data surrounding the use of public space or the importance of restaurants as a whole. <br>With these questions, I hope to claim that dining culture is a very vital part of American culture, yet due to increase use of technology and food delivery services the traditional community spaces are changing. I will argue that the pandemic has started the next era of dining culture and completely changed how America experiences community. If my hypothesis is confirmed it would still be unclear how the new shared spaces will look, but they will most likely be similar to food delivery services: extremely accessible, utilitarian, and based in technology. If my hypothesis is disproved, the “more traditional” shared spaces will continue to have relevancy within American dining culture, while food delivery services will continue to increase in popularity.</p>
     </ul>
     <h3>Method and Design</h3>
     <p>I would collect my data through two different methods: interviews and textual analysis, specifically analysis of national statistics banks. These would be the best methods to answer my research question, as they would give a well-rounded perspective on what restaurants looked like pre- pandemic and post-pandemic. I would try to interview the General Mangers and staff of restaurants, as well as local food delivery service workers. I believe these people are the most important to interview, because they would be able to describe the effect that the pandemic may have had on the community from a personal level, rather than a corporate one, or one based solely on numbers. For statistical banks that I would examine, I think it would be important to study from statics banks like The National Restaurant Association, because of their expertise in studying restaurants and the restaurant industry since 1919.<br><br>For how the design of my interviews would look, I would try to find a mixed age range of 17-65 years old, which would be representative of the population working in restaurants and as food delivery service drivers. I would also try to interview as many people as possible from diverse ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds, in order to be representative of the population in this field of work. In the interview process I would try to use open-form discussion questions to learn from the individuals about their experiences in the food industry both pre-pandemic and now.</p>
