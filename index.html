    <h1>How the COVID-19 Pandemic, and Increased Popularity of Food Delivery Services, Effected the Dining Culture in America</h1>
    <p>The issue I will be examining for my project proposal is how the COVID-19 pandemic, and increased popularity of food delivery services, effected the dining culture in America. I would like to explore “the traditional family outing,” and how it has been impacted, specifically how traditional spaces that were used as hubs for the community have been altered since the start of the pandemic.<br> The general area to be studied is interpersonal communication, as I would be comparing the interactions of people in dining spaces before and during the pandemic, then using the data to illustrate the implications for what shared space could look like in the future. This is an important area to study within interpersonal communications, as it could give insight on what modern, basic, family values are in America; this project would also shed light on the important role that dining and food plays in American culture.</p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
     <p>I currently do not know much about the field surrounding dining culture in America, outside of my own experience as someone who ate in public/ community spaces, and as an employee of a restaurant throughout the pandemic. According to Statista, an online statistical web bank, “Due to measures of social distancing and general caution in public places, consumers were forced to dine out less. According to the source, the year-over-year change of seated diners in restaurants in the U.S., compared to 2019, was -11 percent on October 13, 2021” (Statista, 2021). The information that helped me to find this research topic was found in several statistics charts like the one referenced previously, about the decline of restaurants and shared spaces after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the increased use of food delivery services.  These statistics are important, although they lack the ability to illustrate how it is to experience the effect that COVID-19 has had on how people interact with one another, and how we now experience community spaces (e.g., restaurants). I feel that the statistics leave me asking the question, “Are these spaces an integral part of American culture, to the point that the decline in restaurants should be seen as a loss?” In my project, I hope to examine this question, and detail importance of dining culture within America.</p>
