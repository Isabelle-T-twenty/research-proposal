    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>The issue I will be examining for my project proposal is how the COVID-19 pandemic, and increased popularity of food delivery services, effected the dining culture in America. I would like to explore “the traditional family outing,” and how it has been impacted, specifically how traditional spaces that were used as hubs for the community have been altered since the start of the pandemic.<br> The general area to be studied is interpersonal communication, as I would be comparing the interactions of people in dining spaces before and during the pandemic, then using the data to illustrate the implications for what shared space could look like in the future. This is an important area to study within interpersonal communications, as it could give insight on what modern, basic, family values are in America; this project would also shed light on the important role that dining and food plays in American culture.</p>
